## 0:00–0:30 · The problem · Evan

Let me tell you about a deadline that got missed by one day. The warning was written down the whole time and it was just spread across twelve files and five different note takers.

Everyone's been on a team like this. Writing things down somewhere, and nobody has the whole picture.


## Introduction to the fake team
This is Team 4. Six students, building a volunteer sign up app for a food bank. Their notes, task list, schedule, and the instructor's brief don't always agree.

So we built Receipts.

## 0:30–2:30 · Live demo · Evan narrates, Ben drives

[Ben opens Team 4's board for Wednesday of Week 9.]

So it's Week 9. Receipts have read all twelve files. It shows the three things most likely to go wrong this week.

[Ben points to the top card.]

Here's number one. Ask the food bank for the demo by Thursday, October 22nd. That's tomorrow.

Notice what's on the card: the task, the person, the date, and the reason. Not a dashboard full of numbers. Just something a team can act on today.

Here's why. The course needs seven days' notice to book a sponsor demo. And the demo has to happen by Thursday, October 29th. Count back seven days, and the last day to ask is the 22nd.

Now, you shouldn't just take a tool's word for that. So every line has a receipt.

[Ben clicks the receipt.]

One click, and you see the exact sentence it came from. These are the Week 9 meeting notes, and they say nobody had asked yet. From those twelve files, it pulled out [BEN TO CONFIRM] facts like this one, and every single one links back to its sentence.

[Ben opens the Week 10 board.]

Now let's jump ahead one week. The team added their Week 10 notes, and we ran it again.

Here's what happened. The request went out on October 23rd which was one day late. The instructor had to make an exception.

Nobody did anything wrong here but rather it was just buried in the notes. And our tool flagged it the day before the deadline. 

Ben, how does it work?

## 2:30–3:30 · How it works and responsible AI · Ben

The AI reads the documents, and the code does the math on the dates, so dates are never guessed.

Every quote is checked word for word against the file it came from, and anything that doesn't match is thrown out.

And it flags the work, not the person: it'll say "Kwame is away October 28th to November 1st," but never why.

[Teammate name], what can't it do?

## 3:30–4:30 · Honest limits and what's next · [Teammate name]

Two honest limits.

First, it only knows what's written down. The group chat, email, and Figma are not visible to the system.

Second, pulling facts out of messy notes isn't perfect. That's why it shows how confident it is, and lets people correct it. 


## 4:30–5:00 · Thank you · Evan

That's Receipts. Every warning comes with its receipt, so a team can check it, trust it, and act on it this week.

Thank you. We'd love your questions.

Fira Sans for text, Fira Code for numbers. Titles 44 pt, body 28 pt. Background `#FAFAF7`, ink `#0F172A`, blue `#1E40AF`, amber `#B45309` for the one thing that needs attention. No red. Left-aligned. The live demo replaces any slide about features.

1. **Title:** Receipts. *What will go wrong this week, and how we know.*
2. **The problem:** **12** files. **5** writers. **1** missed deadline *(the last line in amber)*.
3. **How it works:** **AI reads;** code does dates. **Quotes** checked word for word. **Flags work,** not people.
4. **Limits and next:** Knows only what's written down. Shows confidence; people can correct it. **Next:** better top-three ranking *(in amber)*.

## Q&A card

**What if the AI gets a date wrong?**
It doesn't do dates. The AI reads, and ordinary code does all the date math.

**How do I know a warning is real?**
Every line has a receipt. One click shows the exact sentence it came from.

**Where does the team's data go?**
It runs on Ben's own AI hardware, so the documents never go to a cloud AI.

**Could it embarrass someone on the team?**
It flags the work, not the person, and never ranks teammates. It says when someone is away, but never why.

**What can't it do?**
It only knows what's written down, so the group chat, email, and Figma are invisible to it. That's why people can read and correct everything it pulls out.
